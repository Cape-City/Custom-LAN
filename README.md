# Custom LAN
![Screenshot of Custom LAN](https://dimitrodam.com/misc/custom-lan-screenshot.png)
A **Fabric** mod that allows you to customize the following of your integrated server:
* Online Mode
* PvP
* Port
* MOTD
* Anything else you might want, just send me a feature request!

It **only** requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)â€”[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is not required.

If you'd like me to backport it to your favorite Minecraft version, just tell me!
A **Forge** port is currently **not** planned unless if you're willing to help me.
