# Custom LAN
![Screenshot of Custom LAN](https://dimitrodam.com/misc/custom-lan-screenshot.png)
A **Fabric** mod that allows you to customize the following of your integrated server:
* Online Mode
* PvP
* Port
* MOTD
* Anything else you might want, just send me a feature request!

It also allows you to start the LAN world by pressing Enter.

It **only** requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)â€”[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is not required.

It has been backported to all Minecraft versions supported by Fabric (except the snapshots)!
I'm **not** planning on porting it to **Forge** myself *for now* ([this](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/70592-113how-to-use-mixin-for-forge-modding/?tab=comments#comment-341587), [this](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/97430-forgemixinfabric-question/), [that](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118022002/https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/8b68b81a5e48462f8690284a0a3c89a1) and [that](https://gist.github.com/The-Fireplace/d092f25e892a46902ecdec68dee2b938) is why), but you're more than welcome to send me a pull request.
