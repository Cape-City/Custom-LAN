# Custom LAN
![Screenshot of Custom LAN](https://dimitrodam.com/misc/custom-lan-screenshot.png)
A **Fabric** mod that allows you to customize the following of your integrated server:
* Online Mode
* PvP
* Port
* MOTD
* Anything else you might want, just send me a feature request!

It **only** requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)â€”[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is not required.

If you'd like me to backport it to your favorite Minecraft version, just tell me!
I'm **not** planning on porting it to **Forge** myself *for now* ([this](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/70592-113how-to-use-mixin-for-forge-modding/?tab=comments#comment-341587) and [this](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/97430-forgemixinfabric-question/) is why), but you're more than welcome to send me a pull request.
